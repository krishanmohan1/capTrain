/*
    Java is a High level programming languuage , which is easily readable , understandbale and instructable by programmer.
    Why Java is Plateform independent Language?
    - Becuase in java source code is converted into Byte Code which is easily executable in any platform which has JVM.
    - JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, it is physically does not exist, it is used to convert byte code into binary code.
    - It consist of JIT and Interpreter
    - JRE it stands for Java Runtime Environment, it physically exists. It is used to Provide Environment to run java Program
    - JDK it stands for Java Development Kit , It physically exists . It Provide an environment to run as well as develop java program.
    - System.out.print("data"); after printing the data the cursor is shifted to next position in same line
    - System.out.println("MOhan"); after printing the data the cursor is shifted to next postion in new line


    Token
    -the smallest part of java program is known as Tokens.
    Types of Tokens
    -Keywords, Identifiers, Literals, Seperators, Operators
    Keywords
    - A word which are having predefine meaning is known as keywords.
    - It is also known as compiler aware Words.
    - Keywords are always should be in lowercase.
    - In java we have 50+ keywords
    - examples class, public , void, print, System
    Identifiers
    - The name given by the programmer is know as Identifier.
    Rules
    - We cannot use keyword as Identifier.
    - we cannot use space .
    - we can't start with numbers.
    - Special Charaters are not allowrd except underscore(_) and dollar($).
    Types of Identifiers
    -ClassName, VariableName, MethodName, PackageName.
    Literals
    - The value or data given the programmer is known as Literals.
    Types of Literals
    Number
    - Interger
    - Floating
    Character
    - It is used to represent a single data, it is enclosed inside single quote.
    - Length of characte literal is one .
    - We can use UpperCase, LowerCase character, Digits and all type of special Charaters.
    String
    - It is used to represent group of characters
    - It is enclosed inside double quotes ""
    - The length of String literal can be anything
    Boolean
    - Boolean uses only two value either True or False
    Seperators
    - It used to seperate JAVA Members
    Types  of Seperators
    - block {}
    - () -> eaution, methods,declaration, conditions
    - ; -> end of the statement
    - , -> Varibale
    - . Reference

    DataType
    - used to define sixe and type of data
    Primitive DataType
    -Inbuilt datatype
    - Fixed Size
    Integer
    - byte - 1 byte -> 8 bits
    - short -> 2 byte -> 16bits
    - int -> 4 byte -> 32 bits
    - long -> 8 byte -> 64 bits
    Float
    - Float -> 4 byte -> 32 bits
    - Double -> 8 byte -> 64 bits

    Character
    char -> 2 byte -> 16 bits
    Booleam  -> 1bit

    Non-Primitive
    - does not have fixed size
    - user defined
    - String
    - Array
    - ClassName

    Varibale
    Type of Variable
    Based On DateType
    - Primitive
    - Non-Primitive
    Based on Scope
    - Local
    - Global
        - static
        - Non static
